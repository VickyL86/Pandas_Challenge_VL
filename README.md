# PyCity Schools Analysis

The analysis below shows a comparison in student performance across 15 schools from the same district. The sample data is based on 39,170 student records, grades 9th through 12th, for math and reading scores. The analysis attempts to uncover trends and relate them to school type, size, and spending.     
  
At first glance, students in Charter schools perform better than those learning in the district schools. The top 5 institutions report comparable passing percentages and are all charter schools. Per student spending seem not to be a factor or has a slightly negative impact on performance - the 5 bottom being district schools with the highest per student budget. Based on this superficial analysis, it seems like it is the schools' size that plays the biggest role in the overall passing percentage among pupils. The largest schools have both the highest per student spending and the lowest average scores for both reading and math. The school size seem to also have a more negative impact on the math passing scores which in turn lowers the overall average passing score. It is also important to note, that each school's score averages remain relatively flat across grades meaning that the the students maintain the same level of performance across the grades, and it is the school they attend a determining factor when it comes to the average scores.
